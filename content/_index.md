A Fixie Agent is an AI-powered conversational agent that can answer questions, call APIs, fetch live data, or take actions requested by a user. Fixie takes care of connecting Agents to both static data sources and large language models such as GPT-4 or Llama2.

Fixie stores the conversational history between an end user and the agent, ensuring that the Agent can access the full state of the conversation when responding to the user.

A Conversation represents a single conversational session between a Fixie Agent and an end user. The Conversation consists of a series of messages, either from the user to the Agent or from the Agent to the user.

Fixie stores the full history of each Conversation, providing the Agent with the full conversational context, so that it can reference the past messages in the Conversation when generating its next reply to the user.

**Be advised not to introduce in your Conversation any personal and/or privileged and/or restricted piece of information.**
